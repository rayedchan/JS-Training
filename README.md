# JS-Training

* Use var keyword to declare variables that will belong to the current function scope, or the global scope if at the top level outside of any function
* JavaScript value types (typeof): number, string, boolean, object, null, undefined, symbol [ES6], function
* [ES6]: Use const to declare constants
* Object properties can either be accessed with dot notation (i.e., obj.a) or bracket notation (i.e., obj["a"])
* falsy: "", 0, -0, NaN, null, undefined, false
* truthy: "hello", 42, true, arrays, objects, functions
* == checks for value equality with coercion allowed (loose-equality)
* === checks for value equality without allowing coercion (strict equality)
* no strict inequalities (<, >, <=, >=)
* Hoisting = declaration is taken to belong to the enitre scope and accessible everywhere throughout (i.e., a var declaration is conceptually "moved" to the top of its enclosing scope)
* [ES6] use let to declare variables to belong to individual blocks (pairs of {...})
* [ES5] strict mode tightens the rules for certain behaviors ("use strict;") i.e. disallows the implicit auto-global variable declaration from omitting the var
* Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) use to execute function; syntax (function IIFE(){...})();
* Closure way to "remember" and continue to access a function's scope (its variables) even once the function has finished running
* this keyword is dynamically bound based on how the function in question is executed
