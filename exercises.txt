Chapter 1: What is Scope?
E1. Check your understanding so far. Make sure to play the part of Engine and have a "conversation" with the Scope:

function foo(a) {
	var b = a;
	return a + b;
}

var c = foo( 2 );

    Identify all the LHS look-ups (there are 3!).

    Identify all the RHS look-ups (there are 4!).

Note: See the chapter review for the quiz answers!

LHS
argument passed in foo(), a <- 2
var b = <- (a <- 2)
var c = <- (foo(2) <- 4)

RHS
foo function call
var b = a <-2
return a<-2 + b<-2

"who's the target of the assignment (LHS)" and "who's the source of the assignment (RHS)"
